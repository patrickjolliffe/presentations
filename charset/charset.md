#Character Set Fundamentals

---
Character Repertoire: The complete set of distinct characters that a character set can represent
A character repertoire is the set of characters that can be represented by a particular coded character set. 
The repertoire may be closed, meaning that no additions are allowed without creating a new standard (as is the case with ASCII and most of the ISO-8859 series); or it may beopen, allowing additions (as is the case with Unicode and to a limited extent Windows code pages).


Code Point:           The unique numeric value assigned to each character
Encoding Scheme:      How each character is converted to bytes for storage

#Morse Code

The earliest well-known electrically transmitted character code, Morse code, introduced in the 1840s, used a system of four "symbols" (short signal, long signal, short space, long space) to generate codes of variable length. Though some commercial use of Morse code was via machinery, it was often used as a manual code, generated by hand on a telegraph key and decipherable by ear, and persists in amateur radio and aeronautical use. Most codes are of fixed per-character length or variable-length sequences of fixed-length codes (e.g. Unicode).[4]

#Unicode

Fundamentals:
   What Unicode is and why it was created
   Unicode Consortium and standardization
   Code points and planes

   Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP, U+0000 to U+FFFF)
   Supplementary Planes (U+10000 to U+10FFFF)

Unicode Encoding Schemes

UTF-8 (variable width, 1-4 bytes)

How it encodes different ranges
Backward compatibility with ASCII


UTF-16 (2 or 4 bytes)

Surrogate pairs for supplementary characters
BOM (Byte Order Mark) considerations


UTF-32/UCS-4 (fixed 4 bytes)

Direct code point representation
Storage trade-offs

UTF8 (Not to be confused with UTF-8) actually UTFE
CESU-8 (Compatibility Encoding Scheme for UTF-16).

CESU-8 is a Unicode Technical Report #26 encoding form that:

Encodes Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) characters the same way as UTF-8
Differs in how it handles supplementary characters
Uses 6 bytes for supplementary characters by encoding them as pairs of 3-byte sequences
Was designed primarily for compatibility with UTF-16

Oracle's proprietary implementation
Can use up to 6 bytes per character
Created before Unicode standard was finalized
Non-standard implementation that doesn't match the Unicode UTF-8 specification
Still supported for backwards compatibility

Encoded Character Set

A group of characters (for example, alphabetic characters, ideographs, symbols, punctuation marks, and control characters) can be encoded as a character set.
An encoded character set assigns a unique numeric code to each character in the character set. 
The characters that are available to be used in the set (also known as the character repertoire) 
The code points or values assigned to each character
The encoding scheme used to represent a specific character

Naming Convention for Oracle Database Character Sets

Oracle Database uses the following naming convention for its character set names:

<region><number of bits used to represent a character><standard character set name>[S|C]
